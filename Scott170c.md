# Quadruped Robot

## Summary
I am going to build a quadruped robot, similar to boston dynamic's spot that has the ability to walk. I want to build it because I think this is a great way for me to learn how quadrupeds work and the design process that goes into it.

## Plan

Before: Find design for the robot, find places to 3D print parts and model parts on CAD.
days 1 - 5: Assemble the robot (legs, and then the main body)
days 6 - 10: Program and test

## Budget (items subject to change)
